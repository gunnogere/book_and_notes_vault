## 🔍 Validation & Regex Rules

| Field               | Pattern                                              | Purpose                                  |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Title / Author      | `/^\S(?:.*\S)?$/`                                    | Prevents leading and trailing spaces     |
| Numeric Values      | `/^(0\|[1-9]\d*)(\.\d{1,2})?$/`                      | Validates positive integers and decimals |
| Date                | `/^\d{4}-(0[1-9]\|1[0-2])-(0[1-9]\|[12]\d\|3[01])$/` | Enforces ISO date format                 |
| Tags                | `/^[A-Za-z-]+(?:,[A-Za-z-]+)*$/`                     | Comma-separated tags                     |
| Duplicate Detection | `/\b(\w+)\s+\1\b/i`                                  | Detects repeated consecutive words       |
